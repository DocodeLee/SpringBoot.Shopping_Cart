## Utilize Interface
There are several benefits but the best i think is Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern

It is a technique to provide the dependencies of a class, instead of having the class create them itself.

Interfaces are used in combination with DI to provide flexibility, decoupling, and testability.

By injecting interfaces, Spring allows you to provide different implementations of the same interface without changing the class
